 * <h1>Artificial Life Simulator 2017</h1>
 * 
 * The source files needed for the simulation to run<br>
 * Based on Richard Mitchell's Robot.java example<br>
 * But with a lot more functionality. <p>
 * 
 * Technically this is the 4th iteration since the first version had no gui,<br>
 * second had a new simulation system, and the third got lost with no backups<br>
 * after my computer had to be reset because of a boot loop
 *
