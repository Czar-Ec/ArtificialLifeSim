/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
FOR STUDENTS:
FEEL FREE TO USE SOME OF MY CODE FOR YOUR PROJECTS
HOWEVER, I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU CITED YOUR SOURCES
AND NOT JUST COPY MY ENTIRE PROJECT.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

INCLUDED WITH THIS FILE:
- Runnable jar(xf008064_ALS.jar)
- Save folder(sav) included inside are some presets which may be helpful with testing
- javadoc of the project
- copy of the source code(source code copy)
- Resources used in the project (inside the source code copy)

Note: The jar can be run anywhere in your computer, however is it does not detect the sav
folder, it will create one and use that as the source for simulation saves and will not 
be able to use the preset saves.

The Help Menu will open the browser to my website which has the copy of my contacts and
the application manual, but there is a local copy of the manual inside the resources.
